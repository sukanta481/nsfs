# NSFS

This project requires database credentials to be provided via environment variables. Create or update the following variables in your environment before running the application:

- `DB_SERVER` – hostname or IP of the database server
- `DB_SERVER_USERNAME` – username used to connect to the database
- `DB_SERVER_PASSWORD` – password associated with the database user
- `DB_DATABASE` – name of the database to use

These values are loaded automatically by `config.php` and used throughout the admin area.
